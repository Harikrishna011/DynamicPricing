**Understanding Percentile-Based Multipliers in Dynamic Pricing**

---

### What Are Percentile-Based Multipliers?

A **percentile-based multiplier** is a value that tells us how a current data point compares to a specific percentile in a dataset. Percentiles are values below which a certain percentage of data falls.

For example:

* The **25th percentile** (Q1) is the value below which 25% of the data lies.
* The **75th percentile** (Q3) is the value below which 75% of the data lies.

In dynamic pricing, these are used to determine how "unusual" current demand or supply is, relative to typical historical levels.

### Why Use Percentile-Based Multipliers?

1. **Normalize dynamic behavior**:

   * Raw demand and supply numbers can vary widely across regions and times.
   * Percentiles help scale those numbers relative to the dataset's distribution.

2. **Capture extreme scenarios**:

   * If rider demand is higher than 75% of historical demand, it signals high demand.
   * If driver availability is lower than 25% of historical supply, it signals low supply.

3. **Adapt pricing intelligently**:

   * Prices can rise when demand is high or supply is low, and vice versa.

### Real-World Analogy: Student Test Scores

Imagine a class where students take a test. The scores are:

```
[50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95]
```

* 25th percentile (Q1): Below this, 25% of students scored.
* 75th percentile (Q3): Below this, 75% of students scored.

If a student scores 85:

* This is above the 75th percentile (say it's 80).
* Their percentile-based multiplier: 85 / 80 = 1.06
* This tells us their score is 6% above the high-performance threshold.

Similarly, in ride-sharing:

* If 1200 riders request rides, and the 75th percentile is 1000:

  * Multiplier = 1200 / 1000 = 1.2
  * Demand is 20% higher than usual.

### How to Calculate Percentiles (Mathematically)

Given a sorted dataset of N values:

* Percentile rank = $\frac{P}{100} \times (N + 1)$
* If the rank is not an integer, interpolate between the two nearest data points.

**Example:**

```
Data: [5, 7, 12, 15, 18, 22, 26, 31]
N = 8
```

**25th percentile (P = 25):** $0.25 \times 9 = 2.25$

* Interpolate between 2nd (7) and 3rd (12): $7 + 0.25 \times (12 - 7) = 8.25$

**75th percentile (P = 75):** $0.75 \times 9 = 6.75$

* Interpolate between 6th (22) and 7th (26): $22 + 0.75 \times (26 - 22) = 25$

| Concept              | Meaning                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 25th Percentile (Q1) | Value below which 25% of data falls        |
| 75th Percentile (Q3) | Value below which 75% of data falls        |
| Multiplier           | Current value / percentile reference value |
| High demand          | Demand > 75th percentile                   |
| Low supply           | Supply < 25th percentile                   |

Percentile-based multipliers help create flexible, responsive models that scale across cities and conditions. They allow pricing systems to adjust fairly and adaptively using the actual shape of the data.
